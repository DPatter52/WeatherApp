# WeatherApp

# Overview

This is a very basic WeatherApp program that I made to showcase JavaScript in action.

This app simply pulls weather information from an API and displays the information on the page. It allows tracks the search history of the user and saves it in local storage for later use. 
It allows the user to delete the search history so that when they refresh their page, the information will be gone.

I decided to write this software specifically because when I first started coding, I made a weather app but using python. With that app all the information was made up and static, so I 
wanted to make this one using JavaScript to make it more dynamic.

# Future Work

- Fix search bar for cities, so suggestions pop up 
- Assert that text submitted through text box are capitalized appropriately
- Add icons next to weather information to make it more appealing/stylized
- Add a dynamic map 
- Fix the history so that it fully clears without the need to refresh the page
